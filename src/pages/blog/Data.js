          Hurricane Florence delayed renovations, but only by a few days!  We arrived on Saturday, September 15,
          mid-day to begin packing out the house, so that Seth Johnson Construction could get started mid-week 
          with the renovations.

          Sounds Groovy will be undergoing renovations starting September 2018. So, during your
          visit you may notice nail holes, scuffed walls, dated carpet, bare walls and paint 
          samples on walls (see Office bedroom photos). But, the beds are comfortable and the
          house offers many amenities to make your visit enjoyable. The renovation will include
          a new kitchen, flooring throughout, enhanced outdoor living spaces, new outdoor stairs
          and deck railing. Do you have suggestions for improvements we might make during the
          renovation? Let us know!

          The home was built in 1984. It was originally purchased from the builder by Becky
          and Dave Masters. Upon their deaths in 2017, Becky and Dave's sons, David and Mark 
          inherited the home. Michele, Mark's wife, purchased David's half in 2018. The home 
          is now owned by Mark and Michele Masters. In time, Mark and Michele's three children,
          Maria, Gina and Luke will take ownership of the home. We hope to keep this home in 
          our family and our hearts for many years to come!

          Why Sounds Groovy? For over 30 years this was the home to the coolest, most loving 
          grandparents ever! They were wonderful free spirits! Sounds Groovy is an acknowledgement
          of all the beauty and kindness they shared while they were with us. They enjoyed fishing,
          beaching, and love and laughter. Hopefully you will experience that and much more when
          you visit Sounds Groovy!
